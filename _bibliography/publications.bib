  abstract    = {Accurately predicting interactive road agents' future trajectories and planning a socially compliant and human-like trajectory accordingly are important for autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we propose a planning-centric prediction neural network, which takes surrounding agents' historical states and map context information as input, and outputs the joint multi-modal prediction trajectories for surrounding agents, as well as a sequence of control commands for the ego vehicle by imitation learning. An agent-agent interaction module along the time axis is proposed in our network architecture to better comprehend the relationship among all the other intelligent agents on the road. To incorporate the map's topological information, a Dynamic Graph Convolutional Neural Network (DGCNN) is employed to process the road network topology. Besides, the whole architecture can serve as a backbone for the Differentiable Integrated motion Prediction with Planning (DIPP) method by providing accurate prediction results and initial planning commands. Experiments are conducted on real-world datasets to demonstrate the improvements made by our proposed method in both planning and prediction accuracy compared to the previous state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract    = {In recent years, following the advances in autonomous driving technology, low-speed autonomous service vehicles such as delivery, patrolling, and road-cleaning vehicles have started to emerge. As a promising future cleaning solution, autonomous cleaning vehicles are expected to address the workforce shortage many countries face in the near future. This paper describes the detailed design of an autonomous research platform for cleaning operations in mixed indoor \& outdoor environments. An electric manual vacuum sweeper is retrofitted into an autonomous sweeper equipped with the Drive-by-Wire (DBW) system, computer, sensors, and actuators essential for autonomous driving. A complete autonomous driving software stack is also developed upon this hardware setup to enable the vehicle to navigate itself safely in various challenging operating environments. The system has been extensively tested in different environments on the National University of Singapore (NUS) campus, including private roads, car parks, warehouses, and public plaza areas.},

  abstract    = {The construction of a 3D point cloud map for long-term vehicle localization has always been a challenge in the autonomous driving community. In a highly dynamic urban environment, Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems can be heavily affected by non-permanent objects and features during the mapping process, leaving undesired noise in the final map, which is redundant for long-term application. This paper explores applying object detection neural networks in SLAM systems to reduce the effect of dynamic objects (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists). Specifically, we use PointPillars to detect and remove objects first and then perform LOAM to achieve a more static mapping. In the experimental section, the proposed method is validated on the public KITTI Odometry dataset. Compared with the original LOAM, the proposed method can provide a static point cloud map, thus improving the robustness of long-term vehicle applications.},

  abstract    = {Trajectory planning is a critical component in autonomous vehicles directly responsible for driving safety and efficiency during deployment. The ability to find the optimal trajectory in real-time is critical for autonomous driving. This paper presents a novel general framework using the Fast Iterative Search and Sampling (FISS) strategy for sampling-based trajectory planning, which can find the optimal trajectory from an enormous number of candidates with high efficiency in real-time. Specifically, before generating any trajectories, the proposed method utilizes historical planning results as prior information in heuristics to estimate the cost distribution over the sampling space. On this basis, the Fast Iterative Search and Sampling strategy is employed to explore the sampling space for possible candidates and generate trajectories for verification during the search process. Experimental results show that our method can significantly outperform existing frameworks by order of magnitude in planning efficiency while ensuring safety and maintaining high accuracy.},
